## **Minimal, quick starter kit for building apps on top of the DeDe Protocol.**

This repository provides:

* **Local dev environment** (Anvil + Postgres)
* **Market Indexer** that listens to `ParcelCore` events
* **"Pickups near me" API** (`/pickups`)
* **Examples** for deploying the protocol + using the indexer
* **Config system** for storing deployed contract addresses

This repo intentionally **does not** contain Solidity code.
All smart contracts live in the canonical on-chain repo:

**[DeDe-Protocol Repository](https://github.com/pablo-chacon/dede-protocol)**

## **Etherum Mainnet Deployment**

Official DeDe Protocol contract addresses:

* **ParcelCore:** 0xeF1D4970c3B988840B13761Ec4FBb85106d789F8
* **Escrow:** 0x834317eFB2E6eE362a63474837398086cC302934
* **AStarSignerRegistryStaked:** 0x311A4c3Ed79D4467C55dd7CEE0C731501DF3f161
* **protocolTreasury:** 0x9C34d6a6BF1257A9e36758583cDC36F4cE2fA78F

# **Prerequisites**

* Node.js ≥ 18
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Foundry (for local contract deployment)
* Git

---

# **1. Deploying DeDe Protocol Locally (Anvil)**

This repo expects that you deploy the on-chain DeDe Protocol locally and store the resulting contract addresses inside `config/deployments.local.json`.

You can use the included helper script:

```bash
cd examples
chmod +x deploy-local.sh
./deploy-local.sh
```

This will:

1. Start anvil (if not running)
2. Deploy the protocol using `DeployProtocol.s.sol` from the canonical repo
3. Write addresses into:

   ```
   config/deployments.local.json
   ```

Example output of that file:

```json
{
  "parcelCore": "0x123456...",
  "escrow": "0xabcdef...",
  "signerRegistry": "0xfeedbeef...",
  "chainId": 31337
}
```

---

# **2. Start the Template Stack**

### Run everything:

```bash
cd infra
export PARCEL_CORE=$(jq -r '.parcelCore' ../config/deployments.local.json)
docker compose up --build
```

This launches:

* **anvil** (local chain)
* **postgres** (for pickup storage)
* **market-indexer** (listens to ParcelCore events)

---

# **3. Using the Market Indexer**

Once the stack is running:

### List open pickups by region:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8081/pickups?region=SE-AB"
```

### Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/healthz
```

---

# **4. How It Works**

### `market-indexer/src/chain.ts`

* Connects to your local `anvil` node
* Watches `ParcelMinted` -> adds pickup to DB
* Watches `PickedUp` -> removes pickup from DB

### `market-indexer/src/db.ts`

Implements:

* `upsertPickup()`
* `removePickup()`
* `listPickupsByRegion()`

### `infra/sql/init.sql`

Creates a minimal DB schema:

```
pickups_open
  parcel_id
  platform
  reward_amount
  reward_token
  pickup_geohash5
  region
  vehicle
  created_at
```

### `routes.ts`

Exposes the `/pickups` API endpoint.

---

# **5. Customizing the Template**

You can modify:

* Region derivation
* Geohash extraction
* Vehicle type
* Additional filters
* Real-world routing integration

This repo is intentionally small and unopinionated so builders can adapt it quickly.

---

# **6. Production Notes**

* Replace hardcoded `"SE-AB"` and `"u6q4y"` with real geospatial logic
* Use a real RPC instead of Anvil
* Secure Postgres credentials
* Add API rate limiting
* Deploy indexer as stateless microservice (Docker/K8s)
* Configure logging + monitoring

---

# **7. Canonical Protocol Repository**

All on-chain code, tests, and deployment scripts live here:

**[https://github.com/pablo-chacon/dede-protocol](https://github.com/pablo-chacon/dede-protocol)**

This template repo is purely for application developers integrating with DeDe.
