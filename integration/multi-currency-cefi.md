# **CeFi Integrations for DeDe Protocol**

DeDe Protocol is a neutral settlement layer for P2P delivery.
It does not require cryptocurrency for end users.
Any app or marketplace can use traditional financial systems while still interacting with DeDe for trustless escrow.

DeDe only requires that value is converted into an ERC-20 token before entering the on-chain escrow.
All other payment operations remain purely CeFi.

---

## **Supported CeFi Payment Methods**

Platforms may use any combination of:

* Bank transfers (SEPA, SWIFT, ACH)
* Card payments (Visa, Mastercard)
* Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, Klarna
* Local mobile money systems (M-Pesa, Swish)
* Cash payments
* Internal account balances
* Government issued digital wallets

DeDe does not replace these systems.
It only handles the parcel escrow lifecycle.

---

## **Why CeFi Works Seamlessly With DeDe**

CeFi systems already handle:

* identity and authentication
* fiat balances and reconciliation
* fraud checks and dispute resolution
* user accounts and onboarding
* compliance and reporting

DeDe performs one function only:

**escrow to pickup to dropoff to finalize**

The platform remains responsible for all payment acceptance and payout logic.

## **Architecture Overview**

```
User Pays (Bank, Card, Cash, Mobile Money)
                |
                v
        Platform Backend
     (Payment validation and storage)
                |
       Convert to ERC-20 for escrow
                |
                v
           DeDe Protocol
   (Escrow, ParcelCore, finalization)
                |
     Receive ERC-20 payout on-chain
                |
       Convert payout back to fiat
                |
                v
      Credit courier or user balance
```

This is similar to how Web2 platforms operate internally.
They accept many types of payments but settle internally using one consistent unit of account.

---

## **Practical Example: Stripe or PayPal**

1. User pays in EUR or USD.
2. Backend confirms the payment.
3. Backend converts the value into an ERC-20 token.
4. Backend locks the ERC-20 value in DeDe escrow.
5. After delivery, backend receives ERC-20 payout.
6. Backend converts payout to fiat and credits the courier.

All sensitive financial data stays off-chain.

---

## **Practical Example: Cash Based Delivery**

1. User gives couriers cash or deposits cash at a partner location.
2. Courier balance increases inside the app backend.
3. Backend converts fiat to ERC-20.
4. Backend interacts with DeDe normally.
5. After delivery, courier receives fiat from the platform.

This method is common in regions where bank access is limited.

---

## **Security Notes for CeFi Integrations**

* All fiat storage and custody are handled off-chain by the platform.
* DeDe never touches bank account data or card information.
* Conversion to and from ERC-20 can be automated or manual.
* Risk and compliance policies remain fully under the platform’s control.
* Only parcel lifecycle and escrow events are recorded on-chain.

DeDe keeps the financial core neutral and predictable.

---

## **Summary**

DeDe is fully compatible with CeFi environments.
Platforms can accept any payment method and settle funds however they prefer.
They only convert value to ERC-20 when entering DeDe escrow and convert back to fiat after finalization.

This model keeps DeDe minimal and secure and allows platforms to operate entirely with traditional financial systems if they choose.
